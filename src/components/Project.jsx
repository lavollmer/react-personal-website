            <p>
              The robot murder mystery game is a guesswho/clue style game. The
              game player will start the game by pressing a play button on the
              main page. On the main page, the game also includes game rules, a
              github repo link and a scoreboard. We built this game after
              brainstorming unique ways to utilize an API in coding.
