          <h2>Project Robo-Murder-Mystery</h2>
          <p>
            The robot murder mystery game is a guesswho/clue style game. The
            game player will start the game by pressing a play button on the
            main page. On the main page, the game also includes game rules, a
            github repo link and a scoreboard. We built this game after
            brainstorming unique ways to utilize an API in coding.

          <h2>Project SongQuest</h2>
          <p>
            SongQuest is a website for songwriters and music producers. The end
            user starts by either logging in or signing up as a user to upload
            music. In their profile, they are able to upload their music by song
            title, song link and author. Additionally, they are able to see
            other users, and their comments under youtube videos. The end user
            is able to add their own comments to the profile page. The website
            is a responsive, interactive and uses iFrame to embed Youtube
            videos.

          <p>
            This project involved creating a command line user prompt to store
            data about a business. The inquirer prompt asked the end user to
            view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add an
            employee, remove an employee, update and employee, etc. The end user
            is able to change the data based on the request and update the
            printed table of data.
