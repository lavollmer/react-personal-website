        <p>Hello! My name is Laura. </p>
        <p>
          I love using design, user functionality and accessibiltiy to bring
          stories and brands to life. I have a versatile background in
          completion of a coding fullstack bootcamp, the flower industry, and
          healthcare. I believe a website should be visually stunning, easy to
          navigate and intuitive to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a strong passion for problem solving, storytelling and
          inclusion for all. Let's connect and create something amazing!
